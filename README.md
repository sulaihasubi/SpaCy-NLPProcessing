"[spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) is a library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python and Cython. It's built on the very latest research, and was designed from day one to be used in real products" 

Introduction
------------
Tokenizer is a tool that splits a given text into tokens using regular expressions. The process of tokenizing a text into segments of words and punctuation in Spacy is done in several processes. It reads text from left to right. To begin, the tokenizer separated the text on whitespace in the same way that the split() method does. The tokenizer then checks to see whether the substring fits the tokenizer exception rules.
